acsprofile [clear | [<sort-function>] [<limit>]]

Provides {{ACS}} profiling information. Optional arguments can be passed to it:

 + sort-function specifies which column to sort on (total, min, max, avg, or runs). The default is total.
 + limit specifies how many rows to limit the output to. The default is 10. 0 or less will print every script or function that has at least one run.
 + clear resets all profiling statistics to 0. It cannot be used with either of the other two optional arguments.
