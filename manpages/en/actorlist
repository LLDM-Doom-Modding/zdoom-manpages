actorlist [class or {{TID}}]

Prints a list of all actors present in the map, each on a line of the form ClassName at (X, Y, Z). At the end of the list, the total count of found actors is printed. Passing an actor class name to the command, filters the list, listing only those with the matching class name. Passing a TID instead of a class name, filters the list by TID.
