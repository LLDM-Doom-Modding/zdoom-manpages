alias [name] [command string]

If specified with no parameters, alias will display a list of all currently defined aliases. If only command is specified, it will be removed from the list of aliases. If command string is also specified, it will be added to the list of aliases as a new command. For example, to create a new alias to kill the monsters on the level, you can use the command:


 Then you can use the newly created massacre command to kill all the monsters on the level. You can use ; to add more commands:


 That would kill all monsters, give you all invertory and summon an imp. You can use wait (tics) to put a delay between commands. Example:


 Which would kill all the monsters, give all, wait 10 tics and then summon an imp. Also if you run out of space for the alias you can link to another alias. You can easily change your alias by editing your {{zdoom}}.ini file.
 For setting up an alias that both activates on press and release, use +/- before the alias name and bind the key to the + version:


 This can be used to set up special behavior for a button so long as it's held.
