cmdlist [pattern]

Lists all console commands supported by the current version of ZDoom. If you specify a pattern, then only those {{CCMDs}} that match the pattern will be listed. Patterns can contain the wildcards * (which substitutes for zero or more characters) and ? (which substitutes for exactly one character).
