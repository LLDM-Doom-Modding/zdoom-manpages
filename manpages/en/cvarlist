cvarlist [pattern]

Lists the values of all currently defined console variables. Each CVAR can also be prefaced by multiple flags. These are:

 A: Archive — gets saved in the config file.
 U: User — contains user info.
 S: Server — contains server info.
 -: Not settable — can only be changed from the command line.
 L: Latched — changes do not take effect until the next game.
 C: Callback — allocated and has an internal callback.
 *: Custom — was created by the user and is meaningless to the game.

 If you specify a pattern, then only those CVARs that match the pattern will be listed. Patterns can contain the wildcards * (which substitutes for zero or more characters) and ? (which substitutes for exactly one character).
