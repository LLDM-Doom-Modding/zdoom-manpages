mapchecksum [map slot | *] [map slot | *] [map slot | *] [...]

Prints the MD5 checksum for the given map slots. Executing the command without arguments or passing an asterisk (*) instead of a map slot prints the checksum for the current map.
 The engine uses these checksums for its {{automatic}} compatibility. It is computed by using all of the map's core data lump (not the lumps generated by a node builder): the map label if it is not empty (as it may contain {{FraggleScript}}), the {{THINGS}}, {{SIDEDEFS}}, {{LINEDEFS}}, and {{SECTORS}} lumps, and the {{BEHAVIOR}} lump if it is present. For {{UDMF}} maps, the {{TEXTMAP}} and {{BEHAVIOR}} lumps are concerned.
